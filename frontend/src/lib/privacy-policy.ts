Privacy Policy

Effective Date: March 1, 2025
This Privacy Policy explains how Simply Law (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, discloses and safeguards personal information when you use our website, platform and services (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services you consent to the practices described herein.

1. What Information We Collect

a) Information You Provide. We collect information you submit directly to us, including:
• Personal identification data (name, email address, phone number, mailing address) if you register an account;
• Case-related data, documents, messages and other materials you upload or enter into the Service (“User Content”);
• Billing/payment information when you purchase paid services.

b) Automatically Collected Information. When you use the Services, we collect technical data such as:
• IP address, browser/OS type, device identifiers;
• Usage data (pages visited, features used, timestamps);
• Cookies and similar tracking technologies.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information for the following purposes:
• To provide, maintain and improve the Services;
• To process your requests, user registration, billing and support;
• To analyse usage data, debug issues, monitor performance and enhance user experience;
• To train, refine and improve our AI systems and platform (subject to the licence you grant us under the Terms of Service);
• To comply with legal obligations, enforce our rights, prevent fraud or misuse.

3. How We Share Your Information
We may share your information as follows:
• With Service Providers: third-party vendors who assist us (e.g., hosting, payment processors, analytics). These parties are bound by confidentiality and may only use your information to provide their services to us.
• With our Affiliates: internal business units of Simply Law and any corporate affiliates.
• Legal & Safety: when required by law, court order or governmental authority; or to protect the rights, property or safety of Simply Law, our users or others.
• Business Transfers: in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, your information may be transferred — you will be notified of any change in ownership.
• With your Consent: we may share your information with third parties when you expressly authorize it.

4. Data Processing & AI Use
Because we provide an AI-powered service, it is important to highlight:
• Your User Content may be processed by our AI models in order to deliver the Services, to improve our models, or to train them — subject to the licence you grant us.
• We will anonymize or pseudonymize data when possible for model-improvement purposes, and we will apply reasonable safeguards to protect your identity and confidentiality.
• We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
• If you do not want your anonymized data used for model improvement, you may contact us at support@simplylaw.ai and we will allow you to opt out (subject to technical feasibility).

5. Data Retention
We retain your personal data and User Content only as long as necessary to provide the Services, fulfill the purposes described above, comply with applicable legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. When no longer required, we will securely delete or anonymize your data.

6. International Transfers
Your information may be transferred to, stored or processed in locations outside your home country, including the United States. When we do so, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable data-protection laws are in place (e.g., standard contractual clauses, encryption).

7. Your Rights & Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
• Access, correct, update or delete the personal information we hold about you;
• Object to or restrict certain processing of your data;
• Receive a copy of your data in a structured, machine-readable format;
• Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
To exercise any of these rights, contact us at privacy@simplylaw.ai. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.

8. Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or other minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without parental or guardian consent. If we become aware we have collected data from a child under the age, we will delete it as soon as possible.

9. Security
We maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, no system is completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of the Services after changes means you accept the revised policy.
