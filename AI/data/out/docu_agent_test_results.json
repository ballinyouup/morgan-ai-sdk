All of\nthese sources are updated regularly.\nSEARCH FOR COMPARABLES\nWhen a valuation is created the database is searched and\ncomparable vehicles in the area are selected. The zip code\nwhere the loss vehicle is garaged determines the starting point\nfor the search. Comparable vehicles are similar to the loss\nvehicle based on relevant factors.\nCALCULATE BASE VEHICLE VALUE\nAdjustments to the price of the selected comparable vehicles are made to reflect\ndifferences in vehicle attributes, including mileage and options. Dollar adjustments are\nbased upon market research.\nFinally, the Base Vehicle Value is the weighted average of the adjusted values of the\ncomparable vehicles based on the following factors:\n\u2022Source of the data (such as inspected versus advertised)\n\u2022Similarity (such as equipment, mileage, and year)\n\u2022Proximity to the loss vehicle\u2019s primary garage location\n\u2022Recency of information\n\nOwner\nClaim: \n\u00a9 Copyright 2016 CCC Information Services Inc.

WE DO NOT PAY FOR THE COST OF THE GAS, OIL,\nLOANED BATTERY, OR TIRE(S).\nOBTAINING SERVICE UNDER THIS AMENDMENT\nYou may secure service under this amendment in the following manner:\nSIGN AND DRIVE\nThe first method, called sign and drive, features a toll-free number in which the insured calls a GEICO Emergency Road\nService representative who will dispatch a service vendor. Upon verification of Emergency Road Service (ERS)\ncoverage, reasonable and necessary charges for covered services provided will be automatically billed to the Company\nby the Service vendor. The insured need only sign a receipt at the time of service which authorizes the company to\ndirectly pay the service vendor. Any additional mileage, other fees not specifically addressed above, or lockout services\nin excess of $100 will be at the  insured's  expense.\nHIRED SERVICES\nThe second method occurs when the insured does not use the sign and drive feature described above and hires services\nwithout prior approval from the Emergency Road Service (ERS) Department. Upon verification of Emergency Road\nService (ERS) coverage, for covered services provided, up to a limit of $50 will apply. Lockout services are limited to\n$100. Requests for reimbursement must be accompanied by an original itemized receipt and must be submitted within 60\ndays of service.\nThere will be a limit of one reimbursement per disablement.\nWe affirm this amendment.\nW.C.

Therefore, the limits of liability \nwill not be increased for an accident involving an auto that has an attached trailer .\nFINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS\nWhen we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will comply with \nthe law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a \npayment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial \nresponsibility.\nOTHER INSURANCE\nIf there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of \nthe damages. Our share is the proportion that  our limit of liability bears to the total of all \napplicable limits. Any insurance we provide for a vehicle or trailer, other than a covered \nauto, will be excess over any other collectible insurance, self-insurance, or bond.\nHowever, when you, a relative , or a rated resident  rent or lease an auto, the liability \ncoverage provided by the lessor\u2019s policy shall be primary unless the rental or lease \nagreement includes a provision in the form specified in Florida Statute \u00a7627 .7263, as \namended, stating that the lessee or rentee\u2019s liability insurance and personal injury pro -\ntection insurance shall be primary. If the rental or lease agreement includes such a \nprovision, our duty to pay damages under this Part I, and our duty to defend you, a \nrelative , or a rated resident  under this Part I, shall be primary to any liability coverage \nprovided by the lessor or owner for operation of that auto by you, a relative , or a rated \nresident . We have no duty to defend the lessor or owner of that auto under this Part I.\nOUT-OF-STATE COVERAGE\nIf an accident to which this Part I applies occurs in any state, territory or possession of \nthe United States of America or any province or territory of Canada, other than the one \nin which a covered auto is principally garaged, and the state, province, territory or pos -\nsession has:\n1 .  a financial responsibility or similar law requiring limits of liability for bodily injury  \nor property damage  higher than the limits shown on the declarations page , this \npolicy will provide the higher limits; or\n2.  a compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a non-resident to maintain insur -\nance whenever the non-resident uses an auto in that state, province, territory or \npossession, this policy will provide the greater of:\n a.  the required minimum amounts and types of coverage; or\n b.  the limits of liability under this policy.\n8PART II(A)\u2014PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION COVERAGE\nINSURING AGREEMENT \nIf you pay the premium for this coverage, we will pay benefits that an insured person  \nis entitled to receive pursuant to the Florida Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law, as amended, \nbecause of bodily injury :\n1 . caused by an accident ;\n2. sustained by an insured person ; and\n3. arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle . \nPersonal Injury Protection Coverage benefits consist of:\n1. medical benefits ;\n2. disability benefits ; and\n3. death benefits .\nADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS\nWhen used in this Part II(A):\n1.  \u201cDeath benefits \u201d means benefits of $5,000 payable per individual if an insured \nperson  dies because of injury covered under this Part II(A). \n2.  \u201c Disability benefits \u201d means 60 percent of any work loss  per insured person  \nfrom inability to work proximately caused by the injury sustained by the insured \nperson .

However, whenever an in -\nsured is charged with such conduct, the required 30-day payment provision \nshall be held in abeyance, and the insurer shall withhold payment of any per -\nsonal injury protection benefits pending the outcome of the case at the trial \nlevel. If the charge is nolle prossed or dismissed or the insured is acquitted, the \n30-day payment provision shall run from the date the insurer is notified of such \naction; \n4.  sustained by any person, other than you, if such person is the owner  of a motor \nvehicle  with respect to which security is required under the Florida Motor Vehicle \nNo-Fault Law, as amended;\n5.  sustained by any person, other than you or a resident relative , who is entitled to \npersonal injury protection benefits from the insurer or owner  of a motor vehicle  \nthat is not a  covered auto  under this policy; \n116.  sustained by any person while occupying a motor vehicle while  located for use \nas a residence or premises; \n7 .  with respect to work loss , if such bodily injury is sustained by you, and if a named \ninsured has elected to exclude work loss for either you, or your dependent resi -\ndent relatives, as indicated on the declarations page ; \n8.  with respect to work loss , if such bodily injury is sustained by a dependent resi -\ndent relative,  and if a named insured has elected to exclude work loss  for you and \ndependent resident relatives, as indicated on the declarations page ; or\n9.  sustained by any person while occupying  a covered auto  while it is being used \nfor ride-sharing activity .\nLIMIT OF LIABILITY\nThe limit of liability shown on the declarations page  for Personal Injury Protection is \nthe most we will pay for each insured person  injured in any one accident, regardless \nof the number of:\n1 . claims made;\n2. covered autos ;\n3. insured persons ;\n4. lawsuits brought;\n5. vehicles involved in the accident; or\n6. premiums paid.\nIf no emergency medical condition  exists or no determination has been made, the \nmaximum reimbursement for medical benefits  and disability benefits  is limited to \n$2,500. If an emergency medical condition  exists, the insured is eligible to receive \nup to $10,000 in medical benefits  and disability benefits . That determination can \naffirmatively be made only by a physician or physician assistant licensed under chapter \n458 or 459 , a dentist licensed under chapter 466, or an advanced registered nurse \npractitioner licensed under chapter 464, and further can be made only if no physician \nor physician assistant licensed under chapter 458 or 459 , no chiropractic physician li -\ncensed under chapter 460, no dentist licensed under chapter 466, no advanced reg -\nistered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 464, no physical therapist licensed \nunder chapter 486, and no person or entity licensed under part III of chapter 401 who \nprovides emergency transportation and treatment has determined that the injured per -\nson did not have an emergency medical condition . This provision is applicable to \nall claims without regard to the identity, or status, of the entity seeking reimbursement, \nincluding those claims submitted by government entities possessing a statutory right to \npresent claims under this Part II(A). \nBenefits received under any workers\u2019 compensation law shall be credited against the \nbenefits provided under this Part II(A). Any deductible elected by a named insured un -\nder Personal Injury Protection Coverage applies to those persons indicated as subject \nto a deductible on the declarations page . Any deductible that applies to the named \ninsured shall apply to all persons listed as a named insured on the declarations page  \nand any spouse of a named insured. When a deductible applies, the deductible will \nbe applied to 100 percent of the expenses and losses covered under Personal Injury \nProtection Coverage. A separate $5,000 benefit limit is reserved exclusively for death \nbenefits . However, the deductible shall not be applied to reduce death benefits .\n12Personal Injury Protection Coverage is primary to the Medical Payments Coverage un -\nder Part II(B).\nOTHER INSURANCE\nIf there is other applicable personal injury protection coverage for the same injury to \nany one insured person , the most the insured person  may recover is the maximum \namount payable for personal injury protection benefits under the Florida Motor Vehicle \nNo-Fault Law, as amended. If there is other applicable personal injury protection cov -\nerage, and we make a payment under this Part II(A), we are entitled to recover from \neach of the other insurers an equitable pro rata share of the benefits paid and expenses \nincurred in processing the claim.\nIf an insured person  sustains bodily injury  while occupying , or through being struck \nby, a motor vehicle  which is rented or leased, the liability coverage and the personal \ninjury protection coverage provided by the lessor\u2019s policy shall be primary unless the \nrental or lease agreement includes a provision which specifies that the valid and collect -\nible liability insurance and personal injury protection insurance of any authorized rental \nor leasing driver is primary for the limits of liability and personal injury protection cover -\nage required by \u00a7\u00a7 324.021(7) and 627 .736, Florida Statutes.\nCONDITIONS \nIn addition to the duties set forth in Part VI of this policy and the provisions set forth in \nPart VII of this policy, the following conditions apply to coverage afforded under this Part \nII(A).\nPolicy Period and Territory . The coverage under this Part II(A) applies only to acci -\ndents which occur during the policy period: \n1 . in the State of Florida; and\n2.  with respect to you or a resident relative , while occupying  a covered auto  out-\nside the State of Florida but within the United States of America, its territories or \npossessions, or Canada; and\n3.  with respect to you, while occupying  a motor vehicle  owned by a resident rela -\ntive, and for which security is maintained under the Florida Motor Vehicle No-Fault \nLaw, as amended, outside the State of Florida but within the United States of Amer -\nica, its territories or possessions, or Canada.\nDuties in Case of an Accident or Loss . As a condition precedent to obtaining Per -\nsonal Injury Protection Coverage, a person must:\n1 .  cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; \n2.  provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require;\n3.  allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements and \nexaminations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence of you or \nany other person claiming coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may \nask and provide any documents, records, or other tangible items that we request, \nwhen, where, and as often as we may reasonably require; and\n4.  authorize us to obtain medical and other records. \n13Examination under Oath . An insured seeking benefits must comply with the terms of \nthe policy, which include, but are not limited to, submitting to an examination under oath. \nThe scope of questioning during the examination under oath is limited to relevant infor -\nmation or information that could reasonably be expected to lead to relevant information. \nCompliance with this paragraph is a condition precedent to receiving benefits.\nRefusal to Submit to Medical Examination . If a person making a claim under this \nPart II(A) unreasonably refuses to submit to or fails to appear at a medical examination \nrequired by us, we shall not be liable for further payments under this Part II(A). A refusal \nto submit to or failure to appear at two examinations raises a rebuttable presumption \nthat the refusal or failure was unreasonable.\nRight of Reimbursement from Owner or Insurer of Commercial Motor Vehicle . If \nwe make a payment under this Part II(A) to any person sustaining bodily injury  while \noccupying  a commercial motor vehicle , as defined under the Florida Motor Vehicle \nNo-Fault Law, as amended, or when struck by a commercial motor vehicle  while not \noccupying  a self-propelled vehicle, we shall have a right of reimbursement, to the ex -\ntent of our payment, against the owner of the commercial motor vehicle or the owner\u2019s \ninsurer. This right of reimbursement shall not apply from the owners or registrants of \nmotor vehicles  being used as taxicabs.\nUnreasonable or Unnecessary Medical Benefits. If an insured person  incurs med-\nical benefits  that we deem to be unreasonable or unnecessary, we may refuse to pay \nfor those medical benefits  and contest them.\nWe will determine to be unreasonable any charges incurred that exceed the maximum \ncharges set forth in Section 627 .736 (5)(a)(1) (a through f) of the Florida Motor Vehicle \nNo-Fault Law, as amended. Pursuant to Florida law, we will limit reimbursement to a \nmaximum of, and pay an amount not to exceed 80 percent of the following schedule of \nmaximum charges:\na.  for emergency transport and treatment by providers licensed under Chapter 401 of \nthe Florida Statutes, 200  percent of Medicare;\nb.  for emergency services and care provided by a hospital licensed under Chapter \n395 of the Florida Statutes, 75  percent of the hospital\u2019s usual and customary charg -\nes;\nc.  for emergency services and care as defined by Section 395.002 of the Florida \nStatutes , provided in a facility licensed under Chapter 395 rendered by a physician \nor dentist, and related hospital inpatient services rendered by a physician or dentist, \nthe usual and customary charges in the community;\nd.  for hospital inpatient services, other than emergency services and care, 200 per -\ncent of the Medicare Part A prospective payment applicable to the specific hospital \nproviding the inpatient services;\ne.  for hospital outpatient services, other than emergency services and care, 200 per -\ncent of the Medicare Part A Ambulatory Payment Classification for the specific hos -\npital providing the outpatient services; and\n14f.  for all other medical services, supplies and care, 200 percent of the allowable \namount under the participating physicians fee schedule of Medicare Part B, except \nas follows:\n (1)  for services, supplies and care provided by ambulatory surgical centers and \nclinical laboratories, 200 percent of the allowable amount under Medicare Part \nB; and\n (2)  for durable medical equipment, 200 percent of the allowable amount under \n\u201cThe Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetics/Orthotics and Supplies\u201d fee \nschedule of Medicare Part B. \n  However, if such services, supplies or care is not reimbursable under Medicare \nPart B, as provided in this subsection f., we will limit reimbursement to a maximum \nof, and pay an amount not to exceed 80 percent of the maximum reimbursable \nallowance under workers\u2019 compensation, as determined under Section 440.13 of \nthe Florida Statutes , and rules adopted thereunder which are in effect at the time \nsuch services, supplies or care is provided. Services, supplies or care that is not \nreimbursable under Medicare or workers\u2019 compensation will not be reimbursed by \nus.\nThe applicable fee schedule or payment limitation under Medicare is the fee schedule \nor payment limitation in effect on March 1 of the service year in which the services, sup -\nplies or care is rendered and for the area in which such services, supplies or care is ren -\ndered. This applicable fee schedule or payment limitation applies to service, supplies, or \ncare rendered during that service year, notwithstanding any subsequent change made \nto the fee schedule or payment limitation, except that it may not be less than the allow -\nable amount under the applicable schedules of Medicare Part B for 2007 for medical \nservices, supplies, and care subject to Medicare Part B. For purposes of this paragraph, \n\u201cservice year\u201d means the period from March 1 through the end of February of the fol -\nlowing year.\nIn determining the appropriate reimbursement under the applicable Medicare fee \nschedule, all reasonable, medically necessary , and covered charges for services, \nsupplies and care submitted by physicians, non-physician practitioners, or any other \nprovider will be subject to the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) coding policies and \npayment methodologies, including applicable modifiers. The CMS policies include, but \nare not limited to: coding edits, both mutually exclusive and inclusive, payment limita -\ntions, and coding guidelines subject to the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI), \nHospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), Multiple Procedure Payment \nReduction (MPPR), and Multiple Surgery Reduction Rules (MSRR).\nWe will reduce any payment to a medical provider under this Part II(A) by any amounts \nwe deem to be unreasonable medical benefits . However, the medical benefits  shall \nprovide reimbursement only for such services, supplies and care that are lawfully ren -\ndered, supervised, ordered or prescribed. Any reductions taken will not affect the rights \nof an insured person  for coverage under this Part II(A). Whenever a medical provider \nagrees to a reduction of medical benefits  charged, any co-payment owed by an in-\nsured person  will also be reduced.\n15We have the right under this Part II(A) to limit reimbursement in accordance with any \nnegotiated medical provider agreement to which we have access. However, if an in-\nsured person  chooses not to use such a provider with whom we have a negotiated \nagreement, we will not use that negotiated rate to establish what is considered reason -\nable for that area.\nThe insured person  shall not be responsible for payment of any reductions applied \nby us. If a medical provider disputes an amount paid by us, we will be responsible for \nresolving such dispute. If a lawsuit is initiated against an insured person  as a result \nof the reduction of a medical bill by us, other than reductions taken pursuant to FL St. \n627 .736 (5)(a)(1)  (a through f), we will provide the insured person  with a legal defense \nby counsel of our choice, and pay any resulting judgment. The insured person  must \ncooperate with us in the defense of any claim or lawsuit. If we ask an insured person  \nto attend hearings or trials, we will pay up to $200 per day for loss of wages or salary. \nWe will also pay other reasonable expenses incurred at our request. Said payments \nwill not operate to reduce the policy limits of liability.\nNotice That Policy Limits Have Been Reached.  Where a dispute exists between the \ninsured person  and us, or between a person or entity holding a valid assignment and \nus, upon request, we will notify the insured person  or the assignee that the policy \nlimits have been reached within 15 days after the limits have been reached.\nRejection or Partial Payment due to Error in Claim.  Pursuant to FL St. 627 .736(4)\n(b)(3), if we pay only a portion of a claim or reject a claim due to an alleged error in the \nclaim, we will, at the time of the partial payment or rejection, provide an itemized speci -\nfication or explanation of benefits due to the specified error. Upon receiving the specifi -\ncation or explanation, the person making the claim, at the person\u2019s option and without \nwaiving any other legal remedy for payment, will have 15 days to submit a revised claim, \nwhich shall be considered a timely submission of written notice of a claim.\nReasonable Belief of Fraud.  Pursuant to FL St. 627 .736(4)(h), benefits are not due \nor payable to or on the behalf of an insured person  if that person has committed, by \na material act or omission, insurance fraud relating to coverage under this Part II(A), if \nthe fraud is admitted to in a sworn statement by the insured person  or established in \na court of competent jurisdiction. Any insurance fraud voids all coverage arising from \nthe claim related to such fraud under this Part II(A) of the insured person who com -\nmitted the fraud, irrespective of whether a portion of the insured person\u2019s claim may \nbe legitimate, and any benefits paid before the discovery of the fraud is recoverable by \nus in its entirety from the person who committed insurance fraud. The prevailing party \nis entitled to its costs and attorney fees in any action we may bring to enforce our right \nof recovery under this paragraph.\nPursuant to FL St. 627 .736(4)(i), if we have a reasonable belief that a fraudulent \ninsurance act, for the purposes of FL St. 626.989 or FL St. 817 .234, has been com -\nmitted, we will notify the insured person , in writing, within 30 days after submission \nof the claim that the claim is being investigated for suspected fraud. Beginning at the \nend of the initial 30-day period, we will have an additional 60 days to conduct a fraud \n16investigation. Notwithstanding the demand letter requirements of FL St. 627 .736(10), \nno later than 90 days after the submission of the claim, we will deny the claim or pay \nthe claim with simple interest as provided by law. Interest shall be assessed from \nthe day the claim was submitted until the day the claim is paid. All claims denied for \nsuspected fraudulent insurance acts shall be reported to the Division of Investigative \nand Forensic Services.\nLog of Benefits Paid. We will create and maintain for each insured person  a log of \npersonal injury protection benefits paid. If litigation is commenced, then we will provide \nto the insured person  a copy of the log within 30 days after receiving a request for \nsame.\nEXTENDED PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION COVERAGE \nIf you have purchased Extended Personal Injury Protection Coverage, all other provi -\nsions of the policy apply with the exception that, as applied to bodily injury  sustained \nby you or a resident relative , the definitions of \u201c disability benefits \u201d and \u201c medical \nbenefits \u201d under this Part II(A) are deleted and replaced by the following:\n  \u201c Disability benefits \u201d means 80 percent of any work loss  per insured person  \nfrom inability to work proximately caused by the injury sustained by the insured \nperson . Disability benefits also include all expenses reasonably incurred in ob -\ntaining from others ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those services that, \nbut for the bodily injury , the insured person  would have performed without in -\ncome for the benefit of his or her household. \n  \u201c Medical benefits \u201d means all reasonable expenses incurred for medically neces -\nsary medical, surgical, x-ray, dental and rehabilitative services, including prosthetic \ndevices and medically necessary  ambulance, hospital and nursing services. All \nof the following statutory references are to Florida law.

However, any insurance we provide for a non-owned  auto, or trailer  not shown \non the declarations page , will be excess over any other collectible source of recovery \nincluding, but not limited to:\n1 .  any coverage provided by the owner of the non-owned auto  or trailer ;\n2.  any other applicable physical damage insurance; and\n3.  any other source of recovery applicable to the loss.\nAPPRAISAL\nIf we cannot agree with you on the amount of a loss, then we or you may demand \nan appraisal of the loss. However, mediation, if desired, must be requested prior to \ndemanding appraisal. Within 30 days of any demand for an appraisal, each party shall \nappoint a competent and impartial appraiser and shall notify the other party of that ap -\npraiser\u2019s identity. The appraisers will determine the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, \nthe disagreement will be submitted to an impartial umpire chosen by the appraisers, \nwho is both competent and a qualified expert in the subject matter. If the two appraisers \nare unable to agree upon an umpire within 15 days, we or you may request that a judge \nof a court of record, in the county where you reside, select an umpire. The appraisers \nand umpire will determine the amount of loss. The amount of loss agreed to by both \nappraisers, or by one appraiser and the umpire, will be binding. You will pay your ap-\npraiser\u2019s fees and expenses. We will pay our appraiser\u2019s fees and expenses. All other \nexpenses of the appraisal, including payment of the umpire if one is selected, will be \nshared equally between us and you.

Payments made on your \npolicy will be applied first to fees, then to premium due.\nIf a required premium is not paid when due, or by the end of any grace period if we \nagree to grant a grace period, this policy will lapse as of the due date of the overdue \npremium. If we offer to renew or continue this policy, and you fail to pay the required pre -\nmium when due, this policy will automatically terminate at the end of the policy period \nunless we elect to reinstate the policy without a lapse. Your failure to pay the required \nrenewal premium means that you have declined our offer.\n40CANCELLATION\nYou may cancel this policy during the policy period by calling or writing us and stating \nthe future date you wish the cancellation to be effective. However, if your policy pro -\nvides personal injury protection coverage, property damage liability, or both, you may \nnot cancel your policy during the first two months immediately following the effective \ndate of the initial policy period except:\n1 . upon total destruction of the covered auto ;\n2. upon transfer of ownership of the covered auto ; \n3. after the purchase of another policy or binder covering the covered auto ; or\n4. as provided in the Rate Increases provision under this Part VII. \nUpon receipt of a written request, the named insured may cancel this policy within the \nfirst 60 days of the initial policy period if the named insured is a member of the United \nStates Armed Forces and is called to or on active duty outside the United States in an \nemergency situation.\nWe may cancel this policy during the policy period by mailing a notice of cancellation \nto the named insured shown on the declarations page  at the last known address ap -\npearing in our records.\nWe will give at least 10 days notice of cancellation if the policy is cancelled for nonpay -\nment of premium.\nWe will give at least 45 days notice of cancellation in all other cases.\nDuring the first 60 days immediately following the effective date of the initial policy peri -\nod, we may cancel your policy for nonpayment of premium if the reason for the cancel -\nlation is the issuance of a check for the premium that is dishonored for any reason or for \nany other type of premium payment that was subsequently determined to be rejected \nor invalid. If your policy has been in effect for less than 60 days, we may also cancel for \nreasons other than nonpayment of premium\nAfter this policy is in effect for 60 days, or if this is a renewal or continuation policy, we \nmay cancel only for one or more of the following reasons:\n1 .  nonpayment of premium;\n2.  material misrepresentation or fraud by you with respect to any material fact in the \nprocurement, continuation, change, or renewal of this policy;\n3.  material misrepresentation or fraud in the submission of any claim under this policy; \nor\n4.  the driver\u2019s license or motor vehicle registration of the named insured or of any \nother operator who either resides in the same household or customarily operates \na covered auto  has been under suspension or revocation during the initial policy \nperiod or the 180 days immediately preceding its effective date, or if the policy is a \nrenewal, during the renewal policy period.\n41We will not cancel this policy based on the lawful use, possession, or ownership of a \nfirearm or ammunition by an insured or household member of an insured.\nUnited States postal proof of mailing, or certified or registered mailing will be sufficient \nproof of notice. If this policy is cancelled, coverage will not be provided as of the effec -\ntive date and time shown in the notice of cancellation. For purposes of cancellation, this \npolicy is neither severable nor divisible. Any cancellation will be effective for all cover -\nages for all persons and all vehicles.\nCANCELLATION REFUND\nUpon cancellation, you may be entitled to a premium refund. However, our making or \noffering of a refund is not a condition of cancellation.\nIf this policy is cancelled, any refund due will be computed on a daily pro rata basis. \nIf we cancel this policy, or if the cancellation is for nonpayment of premium, any refund \ndue will be mailed within 15 days of the effective date of the policy cancellation.\nIf you cancel your policy, or if the named insured is a service member, as defined in \nFlorida Statute \u00a7250.01, and he or she cancels due to being called to active duty or \nbeing transferred by the United States Armed Forces to a location where the insurance \nis not required, any refund due will be mailed within 30 days of the effective date of the \npolicy cancellation. We may require a service member to present us proof as outlined \nin Florida Statute \u00a7627 .7283.\nRATE INCREASES\nIf we determine that, in accordance with our rate filings and the applicable laws of \nFlorida, you have been charged a premium that is incorrect for the coverage set forth in \nyour application, we will provide notice to you of the amount of additional premium due \nand that you have the following options:\n1.  you have a period of 10 days, or longer if specified by us, from receipt of the notice \nto pay the additional amount of premium due and maintain your policy in force;\n2.  you have a period of 10 days, or longer if specified by us, from receipt of the notice \nto cancel the policy and demand a refund of any unearned premiums; or\n3.  if you fail to timely respond to the notice, we shall cancel the policy and return any \nunearned premium to you. The date of the cancellation will be stated in the notice \nand will not be less than 14 days after the date of the notice.\nAny refund due under this provision will be calculated on a daily pro rata basis.\nNONCANCELABLE POLICY\nIf this policy is issued for the purpose of providing proof of compliance with Florida \nStatute \u00a7627 .7275(2)(a), as amended, in order to reinstate driving privileges following \n42a suspension or revocation due to failure to maintain the required security, the policy \nmay not be cancelled for any reason for the remainder of the policy period once the \npolicy has been in effect for 60 days. After that point, any coverage under this policy for \nbodily injury liability, property damage liability, and personal injury protection may not \nbe reduced below the minimum limits required by Florida law during the policy period.\nNONRENEWAL\nIf neither we nor one of our affiliates offers to renew or continue this policy, we will mail \nnotice of nonrenewal to the named insured shown on the declarations page  at the last \nknown address appearing in our records. United States postal proof of mailing, or certi -\nfied or registered mailing will be sufficient proof of notice. Notice will be mailed at least \n45 days before the end of the policy period.\nWe will not nonrenew this policy based on the lawful use, possession, or ownership of a \nfirearm or ammunition by an insured or a household member of an insured. \nWe will not fail to renew this policy based on if the insured has had only one accident in \nwhich he or she was at fault within the current three-year period. \nWe will not refuse to renew this policy solely because the insured committed a noncrimi -\nnal traffic infraction unless the infraction is:\n1 .  a second infraction committed within an 18-month period, or a third or subsequent \ninfraction committed within a 36-month period; or\n2.  a violation of Florida Statute \u00a7316.183, when such violation is a result of exceeding \nthe lawful speed limit by more than 15 miles per hour.\nAUTOMATIC TERMINATION\nIf we or an affiliate offers to renew or continue this policy and you or your representative \ndoes not accept, this policy will automatically terminate at the end of the current policy \nperiod. Failure to pay the required renewal or continuation premium when due will mean \nthat you have not accepted our offer.\nIf you obtain other insurance on a covered auto , any similar insurance provided by this \npolicy will terminate as to that covered auto  on the effective date of the other insurance.\nIf a covered auto  is sold or transferred to someone other than you, a relative , or a \nrated resident , any insurance provided by this policy will terminate as to that covered \nauto on the effective date of the sale or transfer.\nLEGAL ACTION AGAINST US\nWe may not be sued unless there is full compliance with all the terms of this policy.\n43We may not be sued for payment under Part I\u2014Liability To Others until the obligation of \nan insured person under Part I to pay is finally determined either by judgment after trial \nagainst that person or by written agreement of the insured person, the claimant, and us. \nNo one will have any right to make us a party to a lawsuit to determine the liability of an  \ninsured person.\nAs a condition precedent to filing any legal action for benefits under Part II(A)\u2013Personal \nInjury Protection Coverage or for medical payment benefits under Part II(B)\u2014Medical \nPayments, written notice of intent to initiate litigation must be provided to us in accor -\ndance with the requirements set forth in the \u201cDemand Letter\u201d provisions of the \u201cFlorida \nRequired Personal Injury Protection Benefits\u201d statute. Therefore, we may not be sued \nfor payment under Part II(A) or Part II(B) unless provisions of the Florida statute have \nbeen fully complied with.\nIf we retain salvage, we have no duty to preserve or otherwise retain the salvage for any \npurpose, including evidence for any civil or criminal proceeding.\nOUR RIGHTS TO RECOVER PAYMENT\nWe are entitled to the rights of recovery that the insured person  to whom payment was \nmade has against another, to the extent of our payment. That insured person may \nbe required to sign documents related to the recovery and must do whatever else we \nrequire to help us exercise those recovery rights, and do nothing after an accident or \nloss to prejudice those rights. If necessary to protect our subrogation rights following an \naccident, the insured person must file suit against a liable person or organization within \nthe time period specified by the applicable statute of limitations.\nHowever, we may not assert rights of recovery against the owner or operator of an \n\u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d as defined in Part III\u2014Uninsured Motorist Coverage, if the in -\nsured person under Part III provides us with written notice by certified or registered mail \nat least 30 days prior to entering into a settlement that an offer of settlement has been \nmade by, or on behalf of, the owner or operator of the \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d and we \ndo not elect to pay to the insured person an amount equal to the amount offered in full \nsettlement by, or on behalf of, the owner or operator of the \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d\nWhen an  insured person has been paid by us and also recovers from another, the \namount recovered will be held by the insured person in trust for us and reimbursed to us \nto the extent of our payment. If we are not reimbursed, we may pursue recovery of that \namount directly against that insured person. However, this shall not apply to any pay -\nment made by us under Part II(A)\u2014Personal Injury Protection Coverage of this policy \nfor personal injury protection benefits required under the Florida Motor Vehicle No-Fault \nLaw, as amended.\nIf we elect to exercise our rights of recovery against another, we will also attempt to \nrecover any deductible incurred by an insured person under this policy unless we are \nspecifically instructed by that person not to pursue the deductible. We have no obligation \nto pursue recovery against another for any loss not covered by this policy.\n44We reserve the right to compromise or settle the deductible and property damage  \nclaims against the responsible parties for less than the full amount. We also reserve the \nright to incur reasonable expenses and attorney fees in pursuit of the recovery.\nIf the total recovery is less than the total of our payment and the deductible, we will re -\nduce reimbursement of the deductible based on the proportion that the actual recovery \nbears to the total of our payment and the deductible. A proportionate share of collection \nexpenses and attorney fees incurred in connection with these recovery efforts will also \nreduce reimbursement of the deductible.\nThese provisions will be applied in accordance with state law. \nJOINT AND INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS\nIf there is more than one named insured on this policy, any named insured may cancel \nor change this policy. The action of one named insured will be binding on all persons \nprovided coverage under this policy.\nBANKRUPTCY\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of an insured person will not relieve us of any obligations \nunder this policy.\nMEDIATION\nEither we or you may request mediation of a claim for:\n1.  bodily injury  in the amount of $10,000 or less under Part I\u2014Liability To Others, \nPart II(A)\u2014Personal Injury Protection Coverage, Part II(B)\u2014Medical Payments \nCoverage, or Part III\u2014Uninsured Motorist Coverage of this policy; or\n2.  property damage  under Part I\u2014Liability To Others or Part IV\u2014Damage To A Ve -\nhicle. \nA demand for mediation shall be filed with the Florida Department of Financial Services \non a form which may be obtained from the Department. The demand must state why \nmediation is being requested and the issue in dispute. A demand may not be made after \nsuit has been filed relating to the same facts already mediated. \nOnly one mediation may be requested for each claim unless the parties agree to further \nmediation. The mediator shall be selected by the Department at random. Each party \nmay reject one mediator selected by the Department, either before or after the other \nparty has rejected a mediator. The mediation shall be conducted informally, and may be \nheld by telephone if agreed to by the mediator and the parties. The date, time, and place \nof the mediation conference shall be set by the mediator and shall be held no later than \n45 days following the demand for mediation. All persons participating in the mediation \nmust have the authority to make a binding decision. All parties must act in good faith \nthroughout the mediation. Disclosures and statements made during mediation shall not \nbe deemed admissions in any subsequent action or proceeding relating to the claim or \ncause of action giving rise to the claim. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally \nby the parties unless the mediator determines that one party has not mediated in good \nfaith. Any lawsuit regarding a mediated dispute must be filed as required under the \n\u201cLimitations of Actions\u201d statutes or within 60 days after the conclusion of the mediation \nprocess, whichever is later.\n45\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALL Y LEFT BLANK\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALL Y LEFT BLANK\n9611D FL 0717\n",
