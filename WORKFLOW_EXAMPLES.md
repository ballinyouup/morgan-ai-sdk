Subject: Update on Your Case - Settlement Offer Received

Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you recovering well. I'm writing to 
update you on an important development in your case.

SETTLEMENT OFFER RECEIVED
The insurance company has offered $45,000 to settle your claim. 
I want to explain what this means and discuss your options.

WHAT THE OFFER COVERS
Your total medical bills are $31,000, and you lost $7,200 in 
wages while recovering. The offer of $45,000 would cover these 
expenses with about $6,800 remaining for your pain and suffering.

OUR ANALYSIS
After reviewing your case thoroughly, we believe this offer is 
lower than what your case is worth. Here's why:

‚Ä¢ Your injuries were serious (fractured wrist requiring surgery)
‚Ä¢ The other driver was clearly at fault (ran a red light)
‚Ä¢ You missed 6 weeks of work
‚Ä¢ You're still experiencing pain and limitations
‚Ä¢ Similar cases in our area typically settle for $95,000-$150,000

YOUR OPTIONS

Option 1: Accept the Offer
- Pros: Quick resolution, money in 30 days
- Cons: May be leaving money on the table

Option 2: Counter-Offer (Our Recommendation)
- We suggest countering at $125,000
- This better reflects your injuries and losses
- Pros: Likely to result in higher settlement
- Cons: Takes more time (2-4 weeks)

Option 3: File Lawsuit
- Pros: Could result in higher recovery
- Cons: Takes 12-18 months, more stressful

OUR RECOMMENDATION
We recommend rejecting this offer and countering at $125,000. 
Based on our experience with similar cases, we believe the 
insurance company will negotiate further and we can likely 
settle for $85,000-$110,000.

NEXT STEPS
Please let me know your thoughts by Friday. We can discuss 
this by phone if you prefer - just let me know a good time 
to call.

You don't need to make this decision alone. We're here to 
guide you and will support whatever decision you make.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Legal Assistant
